## What is the `mod` file?

replit automatically adds a `go.mod` file for us.

### What is it?
```
Each Go module is defined by a go.mod file that describes the module's properties, including its dependencies on other modules and on versions of Go.  
```
https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref

```
mod file lists the specific versions of the dependencies that your project uses. The go. sum file provides checksums for the exact contents of each dependency at the time it is added to your module. The dependencies are stored in the Go module cache, which is shared across all projects on your system.
